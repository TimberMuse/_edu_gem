Hi! can you help me develop some class material and a fun and engaging project based learning system for kids around 5-7 years of age? I’d like the project to have measurable outcomes, a hub, dashboard, interactive activities, math and science problems and solutions, ability to generate homework problems and check the answers, can provide multiple ways of teaching and explaining a problem, labs that can be connected to data aquisition devices for fun outdoor labs as well as some hardware integration Iot for the indoor. There should be a ciriculumm designer that can make adjustments from the data gathered from the students work and interactions with the system. The goal is to teach kids STEM in new and visionary ways that not only contain elements of the traditional classroom, but offer a system that can grow and adapt to the learners capacity as well as learn how they learn so that the tailored personal expeirence the student gets is a true mentor. I want to bridge the gap of tradition rote learning with modern technology and hardware. It should get the learner engaged and through a tailored path get the student up and moving around and investigating the world around them and seeing\doing art, music, reading, writing, critical thinking, philosophy, science, STEM, engineering.

This project may span laptops, mobile, desktop, IoT, RPi, Arduino, FPGA, ML, AI, DATA base, data sci and analysis, multiple OS, multiple coding languages, sensors, Cloud services, what ever need to be done to meet the goal.
